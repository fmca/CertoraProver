/**
 * A simpler version of the full [CanonicalTACProgram] and that infrastructure. It fundamentally
 * uses the same idea of the code rewriter. However, instead of attempting to canonicalize meta/summaries and so on,
 * we simply strip *all* of them out. In other words, this canonicalizes of the computational fragment
 * of a program.
 *
 * Additionally, this class is intended to canonicalize subgraphs *not* entire core tac programs (although the resulting
 * canonical program *can* be promoted to a full CTP, see below).
 *
 * The actual canonicalization algorithm is quite simple. Beginning from start point, the original program
 * [prog] is traversed in some canonical order (currently BFS-ish). All variables and block IDs encountered along this
 * walk are assigned some canonical representation using counters. Commands may be excluded via the [include] predicate;
 * if it returns false the command is skipped for canonicalization.
 *
 * As mentioned above, all meta is stripped from all variables and commands. Further, blocks are automatically collapsed:
 * if a block B has a single successor B', then the bodies of B and B' are merged together under the canonical ID
 * assigned to B.
 *
 *
 * A note on summaries:
 * If the canonicalization process encounters a [ConditionalBlockSummary],
 * it will automatically skip to the [ConditionalBlockSummary.originalBlockStart], ignoring whatever 'summary' information
 * is contained within the summary object.
