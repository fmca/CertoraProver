        Finds a representative vertex for each original vertex in the graph.  All vertices with the same representative
        vertex are part of isomorphic labeled subgraphs.

        We use the basic Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm to avoid too many full structural comparisons:

            https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10299993
            https://www.davidbieber.com/post/2019-05-10-weisfeiler-lehman-isomorphism-test/

        Since this is a hash-based algorithm, it is important for the type L to have a good hash function.  Also,
        Weisfeiler-Lehman can rule out isomorphism, but it cannot prove it.  So, for each set of vertices identified as
        possibly isomorphic in this way, we still need to compare the actual labels and edges to see if they are
        isomorphic. This means the worst-case performance of this function is quite bad, but we hope typical graphs will
        do a lot better.
