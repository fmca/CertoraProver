/**
A mutable program data structure for "heavyweight" modifications to TAC Code. This allows:
 * Splitting blocks
 * Adding new blocks
 * Replacing commands with entirely new lists of commands

The CmdPointer class is central; it is used to uniquely identify
the locations of splits, which commands are to be replaced. The CmdPointers accepted by this class are pointers into
the *original* block graph. You are *not* expected to compute the changes to a commands "coordinates" based on other mutations.
In other words, this class takes care to compute the new locations of a commands coordinates that may change due to
graph mutations; i.e., mutations *cannot* invalidate pointers.

Note that this means replacements within replaced code are not possible; they do not appear in the original graph and therefore
have no coordinates. This is intentional, and supporting this would almost certainly cause bugs.
